# MongoLite - Build System Documentation

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Using SQLite Amalgamation

The previous complex build order analysis for individual SQLite source files is no longer needed. MongoLite now uses the official SQLite amalgamation, which provides all SQLite functionality in a single, optimized file.

## Current Build System

### SQLite Integration (Complete ✅)
- **Version**: SQLite 3.46.1 (2024-08-13)
- **Source**: `src/sqlite/sqlite3.c` (9MB complete implementation)
- **Headers**: `sqlite3.h` and `sqlite3ext.h`  
- **Build**: Simple single-command compilation
- **Dependencies**: Only system libraries (pthread, dl, m)

### Build Commands

```bash
# From src/ directory
make all           # Build everything
make sqlite-lib    # Build SQLite library only
make sqlite-shell  # Build SQLite command-line shell
make test          # Build and run tests
make clean         # Clean build artifacts
```

### Manual Build Steps

```bash
# Compile SQLite
gcc -c src/sqlite/sqlite3.c -o src/sqlite/sqlite3.o

# Create static library
ar rcs src/sqlite/libsqlite3.a src/sqlite/sqlite3.o

# Build applications  
gcc -I src/sqlite app.c src/sqlite/libsqlite3.a -lpthread -ldl -lm
```

## Project Structure

```

```

## Legacy Information

The following information was for the previous incomplete SQLite source files and is now obsolete:

---

## ~~Phase-Based Build Order (OBSOLETE)~~

~~This section documented the complex dependency management needed for incomplete SQLite source files. With the amalgamation, all dependencies are resolved internally.~~

**Previous Issues Resolved:**
- ❌ Missing header files → ✅ Complete headers included
- ❌ Circular dependencies → ✅ All resolved in amalgamation
- ❌ Platform-specific builds → ✅ Unified cross-platform code
- ❌ Complex Makefile → ✅ Simple single-file build

## Success Criteria (All Met ✅)

1. ✅ SQLite compiles without errors
2. ✅ Static library links successfully  
3. ✅ Test programs run and pass
4. ✅ Ready for MongoLite API development

## Next Steps

With SQLite integration complete, development focus moves to:

1. 🔧 BSON document storage layer
2. 📋 MongoDB query API implementation  
3. 📋 Collection management
4. 📋 Index optimization
