# MongoLite - Dependency Analysis

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Using SQLite Amalgamation

## Current Dependency Structure (Simplified)

With the SQLite amalgamation, the complex dependency analysis previously required is now obsolete. All SQLite dependencies are resolved internally within the single amalgamation file.

### Build Dependencies

```
MongoLite Application
         ↓
   libsqlite3.a (1.5MB)
         ↓
   System Libraries Only:
   ├── pthread (POSIX threads)
   ├── dl (dynamic linking)  
   └── m (math library)
```

### File Dependencies

```
Application Code
├── #include "sqlite3.h"        ← Complete API
├── Link: libsqlite3.a          ← All SQLite functionality
└── System libs: -lpthread -ldl -lm
```

## Dependency Resolution Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **SQLite Core** | ✅ Complete | Single amalgamation file |
| **Headers** | ✅ Complete | sqlite3.h + sqlite3ext.h |
| **Threading** | ✅ Resolved | Built into amalgamation |
| **Memory Management** | ✅ Resolved | Built into amalgamation |
| **OS Abstraction** | ✅ Resolved | Cross-platform in amalgamation |
| **B-tree Engine** | ✅ Complete | Full implementation included |
| **SQL Parser** | ✅ Complete | Full implementation included |
| **VDBE** | ✅ Complete | Virtual machine included |

## External Dependencies (Minimal)

```bash
# Required system libraries
-lpthread    # POSIX threading support
-ldl         # Dynamic library loading  
-lm          # Math functions

# Optional (automatically detected)
-DSQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION  # Disable extensions
-DSQLITE_THREADSAFE=1         # Enable thread safety
```

## Legacy Analysis (OBSOLETE)

The previous dependency analysis tracked complex interdependencies between individual SQLite source files:

~~- 25+ individual .c files~~
~~- Complex include hierarchies~~  
~~- Platform-specific variants~~
~~- Circular dependency resolution~~
~~- Phase-based compilation order~~

**All resolved by SQLite amalgamation.**

## MongoLite-Specific Dependencies (Planned)

Future MongoLite components will have these dependencies:

```
MongoLite API Layer
├── BSON Parser (to implement)
├── Query Translator (to implement)  
├── Collection Manager (to implement)
└── SQLite Storage (✅ complete)
```

### Planned External Libraries

```bash
# JSON/BSON handling (candidates)
-ljson-c     # JSON parsing (if needed)
-lbson       # BSON library (if not custom)

# Network/IPC (future)
-levent      # Event handling (if network layer)
```

## Build Verification

```bash
# Verify dependencies are satisfied
ldd src/sqlite/sqlite3          # Check runtime dependencies
nm src/sqlite/libsqlite3.a      # Check symbol exports  
make test                       # Verify functionality
```

## Conclusion

✅ **Dependency complexity eliminated** by using SQLite amalgamation  
✅ **Clean build process** with minimal external dependencies  
✅ **Cross-platform compatibility** built-in  
✅ **Ready for MongoLite development** with solid foundation  

The dependency analysis phase is complete. Development can focus on MongoLite-specific functionality.
